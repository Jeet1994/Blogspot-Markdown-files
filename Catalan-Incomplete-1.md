Before we move to Mihailescu's proof, let us cover some more mathematical concepts (so that we feel superior to the people around us, just kidding :smile:),

There is an interesting theorem that Mihailescu uses in his proof, called the **Stickelberger's theorem**,

### Stickelberger's theorem:
This is a result of algebraic number theory, which gives more information about Galois Module structure of class groups of Cyclotomic Fields.
This theorem consists of **Stickelberger's element** and **Stickelberger's ideal**.
I will now state the complete definition of the theorem and then visit its corners as we move along, 

Let $K_m$ denote the $m$-th cyclotomic field[${[1]}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotomic_field) . It is a Galois extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois Group $G_m$ isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo $m$ $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$.
